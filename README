sdl4racket
----------

An attempt to create libSDL 1.2 bindings for the Racket programming language.
I've tried to keep the sdl4racket API as close to the C API as possible, 
so you can use the SDL Wiki and all the tutorials out there.

Of course the functions have more lispy names, for example:

	sdl-set-video-mode instead of SDL_SetVideoMode


C Structures (e.g. all the SDL event structures) are converted to function 
closures. For example, a property like:

	event.key.keysym.sym

can be accesed in Racket this way:

	(((event 'EVENT) 'KEYSYM) 'SYM)


The main C event structure is actually a union. In sdl4racket a call to
	
	(event 'EVENT)

will return the correct event closure, according to the current 
event type.


This binding is not complete, however a reasonable part of SDL_Video
and the event handling is already working.
